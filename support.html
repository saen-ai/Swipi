      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does Swipi work?</h3>
        <p>Swipi shows your photos one by one. Swipe right to keep a photo, swipe left to mark it for deletion. Once you're done, review and confirm which photos to delete.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will my photos be permanently deleted?</h3>
        <p>When you confirm deletion, photos are moved to your device's "Recently Deleted" folder. You have 30 days to recover them before they're permanently removed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does Swipi upload my photos anywhere?</h3>
        <p>No. All processing happens locally on your device. Your photos never leave your phone. We don't upload, store, or transmit any of your media.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I recover a photo I accidentally deleted?</h3>
        <p>Go to your device's Photos app &rarr; Albums &rarr; Recently Deleted. You can restore any photo within 30 days of deletion.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the Random Selection feature?</h3>
        <p>Random Selection picks 15 photos from across your entire library so you can quickly review and clean up forgotten photos. It refreshes every 24 hours.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I find duplicate photos?</h3>
        <p>Tap "Duplicates" in the Utilities section on the home screen. Swipi scans your library and groups similar-looking photos together so you can keep the best one.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does Swipi need photo access?</h3>
        <p>Swipi needs access to your photo library to display, organize, and help you manage your photos. Without this permission, the app cannot function.</p>
      </div>
